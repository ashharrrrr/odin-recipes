    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To get started, you need the right kind of seaweed.
        Spread the seaweed with a layer of prepared sushi rice and flatten gently with a rice paddle.
    </p>

        Here is how I cut salmon for my sushi rolls. First, cut straight down through the filet, then cut that piece in half through the center so you have a small strip
        Place your desired ingredients onto the rice. I’ve got salmon, avocado, and cream cheese.
        Roll it up tightly, using a bamboo mat.Then use a sharp knife to cut the sushi roll into pieces. I don’t find it particularly better to use a serrated knife. Just make sure to use a sharp one!
