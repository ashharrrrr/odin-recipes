    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coconut is one of my favorite flavors, and I love its nutty flavor when toasted. It's a natural pairing with almonds, rolled oats, and warming spices like cinnamon and cardamom; using coconut oil amps up the flavor even more. This recipe comes together in a few minutes and will last for several weeks in a closed container, making it a great make-ahead breakfast option.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups rolled oats</li>
        <li>2 cups almonds</li>
        <li>2 cups unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups maple syrup</li>
        <li>½ cup coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 egg white</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chia seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cardamom</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine all ingredients in a large bowl. Use your hands or a wooden spoon to thoroughly mix, until oats and nuts are well coated. Spread mixture onto prepared baking sheets in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake until golden brown, about 40 minutes. Stir granola and rotate pans 20 minutes into baking time so that it browns evenly.</li>
        <li>Cool completely, then transfer to lidded containers or jars. Store at room temperature for up to two weeks. Serve with milk, yogurt, or your choice of fruit</li>
    </ol>
